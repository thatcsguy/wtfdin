## TOME-001 - Fix tomestone calculation

Changed `calculateTomestonesNeeded` to check `!slotGear.base` instead of `!slotGear.upgraded`.
Base item costs tomes; upgrade material comes from raids (free).

Files: index.html (line ~1392)

Verified: Base checkbox decreases tomes, Upgraded checkbox has no effect on tome count.

## TABLE-001 - Add Source column to gear table

Split Type column into Type + Source columns.
- Added "Source" header to table (line ~2159)
- Moved extraLabel (turn label / tome cost) to its own `<td>` (line ~2102)
- Removed margin-left from .turn-label and .tome-cost CSS (lines ~709-716)

Files: index.html

Verified: Type column shows only "Raid"/"Tome", Source shows "4th Turn" or "495 tomes" etc.
