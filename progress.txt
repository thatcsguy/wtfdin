## UI-002 - Sidebar/Main Panel Layout - COMPLETE

Created index.html with:
- Dark mode theme (vars: --bg-primary #1a1a2e, --text-primary #eaeaea, --accent #e94560)
- Sidebar (280px) with character list + Add button
- Main panel shows selected character details
- Selected character highlighted with bg color + left border accent
- Basic character add/select functionality for testing layout

Decisions:
- Single-file architecture (HTML+CSS+JS inline) for simplicity
- CSS custom properties for theming
- IIFE pattern for JS to avoid global scope pollution
- localStorage for state persistence (implemented early, needed for testing)

Also satisfies (not marked but verified):
- UI-001: Dark mode theme
- TECH-001: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only
- TECH-002: Works as static file
- CHAR-001/004: Basic add/select (partial - needs full verification later)

Files: index.html (new)

Next: CHAR-001/002/003 character management, then JOB-* features
