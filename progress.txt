## TOME-001 - Fix tomestone calculation

Changed `calculateTomestonesNeeded` to check `!slotGear.base` instead of `!slotGear.upgraded`.
Base item costs tomes; upgrade material comes from raids (free).

Files: index.html (line ~1392)

Verified: Base checkbox decreases tomes, Upgraded checkbox has no effect on tome count.

## TABLE-001 - Add Source column to gear table

Split Type column into Type + Source columns.
- Added "Source" header to table (line ~2159)
- Moved extraLabel (turn label / tome cost) to its own `<td>` (line ~2102)
- Removed margin-left from .turn-label and .tome-cost CSS (lines ~709-716)

Files: index.html

Verified: Type column shows only "Raid"/"Tome", Source shows "4th Turn" or "495 tomes" etc.

## UI-001 - Remove hover styling from gear table rows

Removed 3 CSS rules:
- `.gear-table tr:hover` (general row hover)
- `.gear-table tr.slot-complete:hover` (completed row hover)
- `.gear-table tr.slot-partial:hover` (partial row hover)

Files: index.html (lines ~664-666, ~757-759, ~765-767)

Verified: Rows no longer change background on hover. Complete/partial states retain base colors.

## UPGRADE-001 - Add Glaze tracking to raid drops summary

Added `calculateGlazeNeeded()` function that counts tome jewelry slots not upgraded.
Modified raid summary display: 2nd Turn line now shows "X drops, Y Glaze" format.
Glaze appears regardless of base purchase status (per UPGRADE-004).

Files: index.html
- Added JEWELRY_SLOTS constant (line ~1387)
- Added calculateGlazeNeeded function (lines ~1390-1407)
- Modified raid summary loop to include Glaze on 2nd Turn (lines ~2119-2150)

Verified: 2nd Turn shows Glaze count, decreases when jewelry Upgraded checked.

## UPGRADE-002 - Add Twine tracking to raid drops summary

Added `calculateTwineNeeded()` function that counts tome armor slots not upgraded.
Modified raid summary: 3rd Turn line now shows "X drops, Y Twine" format.
Pattern matches UPGRADE-001 (Glaze).

Files: index.html
- Added ARMOR_SLOTS constant (line ~1390)
- Added calculateTwineNeeded function (lines ~1412-1429)
- Modified raid summary loop to include Twine on 3rd Turn (lines ~2144, ~2155, ~2164-2166)

Verified: 3rd Turn shows Twine count, decreases when armor Upgraded checked, disappears at 0.
