## UI-002 - Sidebar/Main Panel Layout - COMPLETE

Created index.html with:
- Dark mode theme (vars: --bg-primary #1a1a2e, --text-primary #eaeaea, --accent #e94560)
- Sidebar (280px) with character list + Add button
- Main panel shows selected character details
- Selected character highlighted with bg color + left border accent
- Basic character add/select functionality for testing layout

Decisions:
- Single-file architecture (HTML+CSS+JS inline) for simplicity
- CSS custom properties for theming
- IIFE pattern for JS to avoid global scope pollution
- localStorage for state persistence (implemented early, needed for testing)

Also satisfies (not marked but verified):
- UI-001: Dark mode theme
- TECH-001: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only
- TECH-002: Works as static file
- CHAR-001/004: Basic add/select (partial - needs full verification later)

Files: index.html (new)

Next: CHAR-001/002/003 character management, then JOB-* features

## CHAR-001 & CHAR-004 - Add/Select Character - COMPLETE

Verified with Playwright:
- "+ Add" button triggers prompt dialog
- Character name entered, created, appears in list
- Auto-selects new character after creation
- Click character in list updates main panel
- Selected char highlighted (bg color + left border accent)
- Data persists after page refresh (localStorage working)

No code changes needed - already implemented in UI-002.

Files: prd.json (marked CHAR-001, CHAR-004 passes: true)

Next: CHAR-002 (delete) or CHAR-003 (rename)

## JOB-001 - Add Job to Character - COMPLETE

Implemented job picker modal with all FFXIV jobs:
- Job data: tanks (4), healers (4), melee (6), ranged (3), casters (4) = 21 jobs
- Icons from XIVAPI (https://xivapi.com/cj/1/{jobname}.png)
- Modal with categorized grid layout
- Already-added jobs disabled in picker
- Jobs display as pill badges with icons
- Close modal on outside click or Cancel button

Decisions:
- Used XIVAPI icons (reliable CDN, correct job icons)
- Jobs stored as {jobId, gear:{}} - gear empty until GEAR-* features
- Modal keyboard accessible (tabindex, Enter/Space to select)

Files: index.html (CSS + HTML modal + JS job data/picker logic)

Screenshot: .playwright-mcp/screenshots/job-001-complete.png

Next: JOB-003 (switch between jobs) or GEAR-001 (gear table)

## JOB-003 - Switch Between Jobs - COMPLETE

Implemented job selection/switching:
- Added selectedJobId to state (persisted in localStorage)
- Job pills clickable, selected pill gets accent border
- Auto-select first job when selecting character
- Auto-select newly added job
- Job info section shows selected job name (placeholder for gear table)
- Keyboard accessible (tabindex, Enter/Space to select)

Decisions:
- Global selectedJobId in state (simpler than per-character tracking)
- Auto-select first job on character switch for better UX
- Job info section shows "Gear tracking coming soon..." as placeholder

Files: index.html (JS state + selectJob function + render updates + CSS for job-info)

Screenshot: .playwright-mcp/job-003-switch-jobs.png

Next: GEAR-001 (gear table) - prerequisite for most remaining features

## GEAR-001 - Gear Table with 11 Equipment Slots - COMPLETE

Implemented gear table displaying all 11 slots:
- Weapon, Head, Body, Hands, Legs, Feet, Earrings, Necklace, Bracelets, Ring1, Ring2
- Each slot shows: name, type (Raid/Tome), checkboxes
- Raid slots: single "Have" checkbox
- Tome slots: "Base" + "Upgraded" checkboxes
- Checkbox state persists to localStorage
- Table renders when job selected

Decisions:
- Default BiS preset: weapon=raid, alternating for armor, mix for accessories
- getBiSPreset(jobId) stub for future per-job presets
- CSS badges for slot types: Raid (pink), Tome (blue)
- Checkboxes update state immediately, re-render on change

Files: index.html (CSS gear-table styles, JS GEAR_SLOTS/DEFAULT_BIS data, renderMainPanel gear table, handleGearCheckbox)

Screenshot: .playwright-mcp/gear-001-complete.png

Next: GEAR-002/003/004 (checkbox behaviors) or GEAR-005 (per-job BiS)

## GEAR-002/003/004 - Checkbox Behaviors - COMPLETE

GEAR-002: Raid slots show single "Have" checkbox
- Already implemented in GEAR-001
- Verified persistence after refresh

GEAR-003: Tome slots show "Base" + "Upgraded" checkboxes
- Already implemented in GEAR-001
- Base can be checked independently
- Persistence verified

GEAR-004: Checking Upgraded auto-checks Base
- Added logic in handleGearCheckbox()
- When field='upgraded' && checked, also sets base=true
- Tested: clicking Upgraded on unchecked slot auto-checks Base

Files: index.html (handleGearCheckbox updated), prd.json (marked passes:true)

Screenshot: .playwright-mcp/gear-004-auto-base.png

Next: GEAR-005 (per-job BiS) or GEAR-006 (visual completion status)

## GEAR-005 - Per-Job BiS Presets - COMPLETE

Implemented unique BiS presets for all 21 jobs:
- JOB_BIS_PRESETS object with raid/tome config per slot per job
- Tanks: PLD, WAR, DRK, GNB - each different based on stat priorities
- Healers: WHM, SCH, AST, SGE - varied Crit/Det/Piety builds
- Melee: MNK, DRG, NIN, SAM, RPR, VPR - Crit/DH focused variations
- Ranged: BRD, MCH, DNC - different optimal configs
- Casters: BLM, SMN, RDM, PCT - SpS vs Crit build variations
- getBiSPreset(jobId) returns job-specific preset or DEFAULT_BIS fallback

Verified with Playwright:
- DRK, WHM, BLM all show distinct BiS configurations
- Switching jobs updates gear table with correct preset
- Slot types (Raid/Tome badges) match per-job preset

Files: index.html (JOB_BIS_PRESETS data, getBiSPreset function), prd.json (GEAR-005 passes:true)

Screenshot: .playwright-mcp/gear-005-per-job-bis.png

Next: GEAR-006 (visual completion) or PROG-001 (progress display)

## DATA-001/002 - Data Persistence - COMPLETE

Verified localStorage persistence already working:
- Characters, jobs, gear states all persist after refresh
- Auto-save on every change (no save button needed)
- Selected character/job state reasonable on reload

No code changes - already implemented early for testing.

Files: prd.json (DATA-001, DATA-002 marked passes:true)

## GEAR-006 - Visual Completion Status - COMPLETE

Added CSS classes for slot completion states:
- .slot-complete: green bg (rgba 46,204,113 @ 15%) for fully complete
- .slot-partial: yellow/amber bg (rgba 241,196,15 @ 15%) for Base-only tome
- Both have hover variants at 25% opacity

Updated renderMainPanel to add classes based on gear state:
- Raid: complete if have=true
- Tome: complete if upgraded=true, partial if base=true only

Verified with Playwright:
- Weapon (raid, have=true): green highlight
- Head (tome, base only): yellow/amber highlight
- Body (tome, base+upgraded): green highlight
- Other slots (incomplete): no highlight

Files: index.html (CSS + JS render logic), prd.json (GEAR-006 passes:true)

Screenshot: .playwright-mcp/gear-006-complete.png

Next: PROG-001 (progress display) or remaining features
