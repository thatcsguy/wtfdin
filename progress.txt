## TOME-001 - Fix tomestone calculation

Changed `calculateTomestonesNeeded` to check `!slotGear.base` instead of `!slotGear.upgraded`.
Base item costs tomes; upgrade material comes from raids (free).

Files: index.html (line ~1392)

Verified: Base checkbox decreases tomes, Upgraded checkbox has no effect on tome count.
