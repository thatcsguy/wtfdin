## UI-002 - Sidebar/Main Panel Layout - COMPLETE

Created index.html with:
- Dark mode theme (vars: --bg-primary #1a1a2e, --text-primary #eaeaea, --accent #e94560)
- Sidebar (280px) with character list + Add button
- Main panel shows selected character details
- Selected character highlighted with bg color + left border accent
- Basic character add/select functionality for testing layout

Decisions:
- Single-file architecture (HTML+CSS+JS inline) for simplicity
- CSS custom properties for theming
- IIFE pattern for JS to avoid global scope pollution
- localStorage for state persistence (implemented early, needed for testing)

Also satisfies (not marked but verified):
- UI-001: Dark mode theme
- TECH-001: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only
- TECH-002: Works as static file
- CHAR-001/004: Basic add/select (partial - needs full verification later)

Files: index.html (new)

Next: CHAR-001/002/003 character management, then JOB-* features

## CHAR-001 & CHAR-004 - Add/Select Character - COMPLETE

Verified with Playwright:
- "+ Add" button triggers prompt dialog
- Character name entered, created, appears in list
- Auto-selects new character after creation
- Click character in list updates main panel
- Selected char highlighted (bg color + left border accent)
- Data persists after page refresh (localStorage working)

No code changes needed - already implemented in UI-002.

Files: prd.json (marked CHAR-001, CHAR-004 passes: true)

Next: CHAR-002 (delete) or CHAR-003 (rename)

## JOB-001 - Add Job to Character - COMPLETE

Implemented job picker modal with all FFXIV jobs:
- Job data: tanks (4), healers (4), melee (6), ranged (3), casters (4) = 21 jobs
- Icons from XIVAPI (https://xivapi.com/cj/1/{jobname}.png)
- Modal with categorized grid layout
- Already-added jobs disabled in picker
- Jobs display as pill badges with icons
- Close modal on outside click or Cancel button

Decisions:
- Used XIVAPI icons (reliable CDN, correct job icons)
- Jobs stored as {jobId, gear:{}} - gear empty until GEAR-* features
- Modal keyboard accessible (tabindex, Enter/Space to select)

Files: index.html (CSS + HTML modal + JS job data/picker logic)

Screenshot: .playwright-mcp/screenshots/job-001-complete.png

Next: JOB-003 (switch between jobs) or GEAR-001 (gear table)

## JOB-003 - Switch Between Jobs - COMPLETE

Implemented job selection/switching:
- Added selectedJobId to state (persisted in localStorage)
- Job pills clickable, selected pill gets accent border
- Auto-select first job when selecting character
- Auto-select newly added job
- Job info section shows selected job name (placeholder for gear table)
- Keyboard accessible (tabindex, Enter/Space to select)

Decisions:
- Global selectedJobId in state (simpler than per-character tracking)
- Auto-select first job on character switch for better UX
- Job info section shows "Gear tracking coming soon..." as placeholder

Files: index.html (JS state + selectJob function + render updates + CSS for job-info)

Screenshot: .playwright-mcp/job-003-switch-jobs.png

Next: GEAR-001 (gear table) - prerequisite for most remaining features
